# Considerations when using Credential Guard

**Applies to**
-   Windows 10
-   Windows Server 2016

in the Deep Dive into Credential Guard video series.
     
-  Passwords are still weak so we recommend that your organization deploy Credential Guard and move away from passwords and to other authentication methods, such as physical smart cards, virtual smart cards, or Windows Hello for Business.
-   Some 3rd party Security Support Providers (SSPs and APs) might not be compatible with Credential Guard. Credential Guard does not allow 3rd party SSPs to ask for password hashes from LSA. However, SSPs and APs still get notified of the password when a user logs on and/or changes their password. Any use of undocumented APIs within custom SSPs and APs are not supported. We recommend that custom implementations of SSPs/APs are tested against Credential Guard to ensure that the SSPs and APs do not depend on any undocumented or unsupported behaviors. For example, using the KerbQuerySupplementalCredentialsMessage API is not supported. You should not replace the NTLM or Kerberos SSPs with custom SSPs and APs. For more info, see [Restrictions around Registering and Installing a Security Package](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/dn865014.aspx) on MSDN.
-   As the depth and breadth of protections provided by Credential Guard are increased, subsequent releases of Windows 10 with Credential Guard running may impact scenarios that were working in the past. For example, Credential Guard may block the use of a particular type of credential or a particular component to prevent malware from taking advantage of vulnerabilities. Therefore, we recommend that scenarios required for operations in an organization are tested before upgrading a device that has Credential Guard running.

-   Starting with Windows 10, version 1511, domain credentials that are stored with Credential Manager are protected with Credential Guard. Credential Manager allows you to store credentials, such as user names and passwords that you use to log on to websites or other computers on a network. The following considerations apply to the Credential Guard protections for Credential Manager:
    -   Credentials saved by Remote Desktop Services cannot be used to remotely connect to another machine without supplying the password. Attempts to use saved credentials will fail, displaying the error message "Logon attempt failed".
    -   Applications that extract derived domain credentials from Credential Manager will no longer be able to use those credentials.
    -   You cannot restore credentials using the Credential Manager control panel if the credentials were backed up from a PC that has Credential Guard turned on. If you need to back up your credentials, you must do this before you enable Credential Guard. Otherwise, you won't be able to restore those credentials.
    - Credential Guard uses hardware security so some features, such as Windows To Go, are not supported. 

## Wi-fi and VPN Considerations
When you enable Credential Guard, you can no longer use NTLM v1 authentication. If you are using WiFi and VPN endpoints that are based on MS-CHAPv2, they are subject to similar attacks as for NTLMv1. For WiFi and VPN connections, Microsoft recommends that organizations move from MSCHAPv2-based connections such as PEAP-MSCHAPv2 and EAP-MSCHAPv2, to certificate-based authentication such as PEAP-TLS or EAP-TLS. 


## Kerberos Considerations

When you enable Credential Guard, you can no longer use Kerberos unconstrained delegation or DES encryption. Unconstrained delegation could allow attackers to extract Kerberos keys from the isolated LSA process. You must use constrained or resource-based Kerberos delegation instead.
