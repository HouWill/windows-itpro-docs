# ICSPNode::Execute

This method runs a task on an internally-transactioned configuration service provider node by passing in the specified user data and returning a result. The exact meaning of **Execute** and whether it is even supported depends on the purpose of the node. For example, **Execute** called on a node that represents a file should probably **ShellExecute** the file, whereas calling **Execute** on a registry node generally does not make sense.

## Syntax

``` syntax
HRESULT Execute([in] VARIANT varUserData);
```

## Parameters

<a href="" id="varuserdata"></a>*varUserData*  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Data to pass into the execution.

## Return Value

A value of S\_OK indicates that the operation was performed successfully on the node. E\_NOTIMPL should be returned if this method is not implemented.

## Remarks

Externally–transactioned nodes do not support this method.

## Requirements

**Header:** None
