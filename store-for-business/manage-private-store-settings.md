# Manage private store settings

**Applies to**

-   Windows 10
-   Windows 10 Mobile

The private store is a feature in Microsoft Store for Business and Education that organizations receive during the sign up process. When admins add apps to the private store, all people in the organization can view and download the apps. Only online-licensed apps can be distributed from your private store.

The name of your private store is shown on a tab in Windows Store app, or on [Microsoft Store for Business](https://businessstore.microsoft.com), or [Microsoft Store for Education](https://educationstore.microsoft.com).
